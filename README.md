Project：
I was thinking and attempting to create a translation project. In my point of view, if a person who is not able to speak Chinese lives in a Chinese environment, how helpless and embarrassed he is. I was considering what kind of translation project should I choose because if I tried to translate all the Chinese to English and all the English to Chinese, there are too many words and work. Thus I decided to work on the translation of fruit. In this translation app, you can translate the name of fruit from both English to Chinese and Chinese to English. It is very helpful for the people who only know the name of the fruit in his native language.

## Big Picture
The big picture of the project. 
I decided to work on the translation of fruit. In this translation app, you can translate the name of fruit from both English to Chinese and Chinese to English. It is very helpful for the people who only know the name of the fruit in his native language.

## First Round
What I hoped to accomplish in the first round in about 2 weeks.
I hope I can set up a basic translation of the program, put the fruits in Chinese and English. Make sure people can translate the fruits name into English or Chinese. In addition, people who can’t find out their translations on the program, they can add their words in Chinese and English themselves.

## Test Plan for 1st round
First, the user will need to type in one of the fruit words shows on the screen
Second, it will show up the words in Chinese or English that the user type.
If there is no translation of their words, the program will ask you to add the words in both Chinese and English. When you type it again, the word the user add will show on the program.
>The program will show Translations:
>User enters: Avocado
>the program will shows ：鳄梨
If the program does not have the words
>The program will show Translations:
>User enters：baby
>the program will show ：There is no definition of this word? What is the Chinese word?
>User enters:宝贝
>the program will show ：What is the word in English?
>user enters: baby

## Reflections and revisions
How did it go? Do you have changes to the big picture?
I think the program is going well, it works well. I think I should makes this program more like a real thing, maybe a fruit store? There will have the conversation between the store owner and the customer. It will make  the program more realistic and interesting.
## Next steps
What do I hope to accomplish in the next round?
The conversation characters set up, the store's background set up. Such as what will the character talk about in the conversation. Once the customer gets to the store, what will the store owner say?
Store owner=the program
Customer=the user
